# Divulge

A very minimal template for creating reveal.js slides quickly.

This is a `npm install` based version of reveal.js with lots of ... some might
call it "bloat" ... out of the way. Focus on the essentials! The slides!

## Install

1. Clone as usual.
2. Install a node of your choice.
   I recommend using a latest release via nvm - Node Version Manager.
   > There is a very nice manual by [Microsoft ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
3. `cd` into the project.
4. Install necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Fire up the presentation with: 
   
```bash
npm run show
```

6. Open up a browser and load http://localhost:3000.
7. Edit your set of slides at [slides](slides/). =)

## Slides

All slides reside in the `slides` folder. The main grouping "slide" is
[content.html](slides/content.html). Start editing this one check the 
slides subfolder for examples and references.
